# ZoologicardPublicInfo
This hosts parts of Zoologicard (an Android app - card game with animals) that are publically available.

At the moment there is no way of contributing to Zoologicard. The only publically available information is the privacy policy.

But there are plans to introduce methods of contributing in the future. This goes for code as well as artwork (such as photos, pixel artwork or music).
